I am from the city of Penza, Russia. I am 52 years old. I am a retired military officer. 
In addition to my main job as a furniture manufacturing operator, 
I am engaged in self-education in the field of web development. 
Before studying at RS school, I studied online in various courses that remained unfinished.
The authors of paid courses advertise that after 5-6 months of training you will become a web developer. 
Now I understand that this is not the case, that it takes much more time to study theory and gain practical skills.
With the help of a course from RS School, I have a self-study plan for a period of up to 12 months, 
possibly for a longer period. I think that my strengths: analytical mindset, 
organization and perseverance will help me become a web developer.
**As they say, the road will be mastered by the walking!**
